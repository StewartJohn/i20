								<h3>Stardate 0784669</h3>
								<p>First day on the ship and goodness am I excited. It sounds like they start the learning process with a discussion of norms and community guidelines. I hope they use a co-constructed model for that on this ship because we Heraldhogs rely on relationship building and tend to get fairly anxious when stressed and eek! I am just not sure I can succeed as a...</p>
								<p>[muffled noises]</p>
								<p>[deep breathing]</p>
								<p>[footsteps approaching]</p>
								<p>Sorry, had to step away from the Alexa6000Z Optimal Reflection Recorder for a moment...I could feel my core starting to roll. In any case, I just hope we get to know each other first before we’re expected to dive into work and engage with each other.</p>
								<h3>Stardate 0784670</h3>
								<p>All we went over yesterday during orientation was the ship manual and our major assignments. I am not sure how this is going to go, I’ve been assigned to be Navigator.</p> 
								<h3>Stardate 0784701</h3>
								<p>Nothing to report. Smooth travelling so far and I am pleased to share it!</p>
								<h3>Stardate 0784735</h3>
								<p>Did you know that the food system on the i17 starbase is fully sustainable?! Though I was assigned Navigator, I have found I quite like spending time in the kitchen. There is something about the need for order and detail and the fact that they also have to manage three other systems that I just love in that sector. </p>
								<h3>Stardate 0784736</h3>
								<p>It happened…it finally happened. There I was, interfacing with the Navitron...flowing like the peaceful and delighted Heraldhog I love to be...when the Captain reported we just intercepted a transmission stating that a reflective black hole had been strategically set as a defensive maneuver by a band of non-permitted intergalactic asteroid miners and happened to be in our path.</p>
								<p>And just like that the whole crew witnessed my spiny side. What’s more, in the stress of the moment, the Captain had to take over the Navitron. Fortunately, he managed to clear us from the reflective black hole’s path, but I uncontrollably rolled off the Flight Deck. I overheard that I am being reassigned tonight and that in his logs the Captain plans to write to the Federation to recommend Heraldhogs not be assigned the the Flight Deck. Truthfully, I am relieved by this last part.</p>
