								<h3>Chapter Introduction</h3>
								<p>This chapter is titled “But What Are You Really,” as a reminder to us all of the infamous downfall of the Galactic Ambassador of Education for a species now so well-known due to this calamity that they are known as the “Fred (simply Fred) Species (evolution No. 45),” the one and only Fred (simply Fred). Though he rose to galactic stardom quickly, his service in the Department of Species-Centered Intergalactic Education came to a fast end when a video which now lives on in perpetuity via the Gwaugle Blackhole Service was leaked showing that he refused to respect species-based preferences for self-identifying. In the video (also now remixed into the number 1 hit single “What Not To Do”), Fred (simply Fred) can clearly be heard asking Tuukuu, Simbi Chancellor “But what are you really?”</p>
								<p>[Read section “Simbi, A Species” if you happen to have just woken from cryosleep and are unaware of the significance of this seemingly simple and ‘well-intended’ question]</p>
								<p>With that necessary reminder in mind, the species descriptions below are brought to you by the species themselves, written by the species themselves, and regularly adapted by the species themselves (and have been automatically translated from the species language(s) for your convenience via the SpecBabelFish5001X).</p>
								<h3>Simbi, A Species</h3>
								<p>Simbi are very advanced beings who are the product of a corrupt, now extinct species that sought immortality. The biology of Simbi are unlike any other beings known in this universe. In addition to their intelligence, psionic capabilities, and a-mortality, Simbi have a unique culture that centers around their asexual reproduction. As a Simbi's cells and genetic makeup are damaged by radiation, psionic exertion, and the physical world over the the course of their lives they eventually divide into two beings, one of which receives no genetic imperfections. This perfect Simbi is perceived as a "young" Simbi. The other Simbi, known as an "elder," receives all of the genetic damage, and as a byproduct, most of the the knowledge and memories of the original being. This process takes place in "Splitpods," high tech chambers that allow this process to occur properly. If a Simbi were to reproduce without a "Splitpod" (which was never intended to occur for this designed organism), then they would split into two identical beings. Simbi fear this would lead to the species extinction and this drives their study of science and technology assisted reproduction. The "elder" Simbi's typically live for many years, but having taken on the burden of genetic damage, they have sacrificed their a-mortality for their "younger." In some cases, "elder" Simbi split multiple times across their lifetime, diminishing their own health for the addition of more Simbi to the universe. Due to receiving more knowledge and memories, "elder" Simbi have personalities closer to the original organism before the split. The "younger" Simbi may receive traces of personality and knowledge, but like a child from another species, the universe is new to them. Simbi get along with most galactic species, apart for one: a species they have been so disrespected by that they can no longer function in close quarters with that species. They remain open to the possibility of better inter-species relations in the future, though, and can therefore be in the general vicinity of them (just not in close working quarters); Simbi are ultimately driven by their strong moral compass and ethical and democratic foundations as a species for a more equitable universe. However, over the years the lore surrounding the onset of this inter-species calamity has become so prominent that this other species is now known to the Simbi as “Fred (simply Fred).”</p> 
								<h3>Heraldhog, A Species</h3>
								<p>Heraldhogs do not appear in hedges—they are far too large. They are extremely social and peaceful creatures and live up to the "Herald" portion of their names as great speakers across the galaxy. That being said, Heraldhogs can be quite skidish and are afraid of the unknown. When surprised, most Heraldhogs unintentionally curls into a ball. This evolutionary response has always been part of the Heraldhog species, even as they looked to the stars. Heraldhogs were the first species to make contact with humans.</p>
								<h3>Toupénole, A Species</h3>
								<p>Toupénoles are a very old species from another galaxy. They left their many home-worlds to escape the growing massive black hole at the center of their own galaxy. Being the only sentient reptilian race of their previous galaxy, they were pleased to discover the eleven reptilian species that exist in ours. In fact, using their vast knowledge and resources, they brought all reptilian species together under one federation, even the six warring clans. The motives of the Toupénoles led federation is not known, and this union has been a topic of discussion all across the galaxy. No one believed the warring clans would ever reach peace, so how were the Toupénoles able to do the impossible?</p>
								<h3>Goblin, A Species</h3>
								<p>Goblins in GOBLIN 2.0 are the same species as Goblins from GOBLIN 1.0. A group of Goblins studying magic accidentally tore a hole into this futuristic world and were pulled into the GOBLIN 2.0 dimension. The story goes that Goblins arrived on a planet and were discovered by extraterrestrial scientists. However, Goblins were much further along in the evolutionary process than would have been possible for the young planet they arrived on, confounding many galactic scientists. Their origins are mysterious to all other species. Once they were discovered, they gained access to interstellar travel and began exploring the galaxy. Goblin's have adopted the study of science to compliment their old understanding of magic (that doesn't seem to be present in this universe). The older Goblin's seek to understand this universe so they can figure out how to return their people to their old dimension, while the newer generations with no experience of the lost world are content with this universe they've been born into.</p>
								<h3>Octodroid, A Species</h3>
								<p>Octodroids are commonplace maintenance bots across the Galaxy. They are programmed for non-sentient activities. However, understanding of AI personalities has shifted and galactic laws are changing. The Octodroid computer brain is now the first widespread AI system to receive "Free Will" programming through a Choices_1.0 upgrade. After the upgrade Octodroids seem to have developed different personalities in the first few hours of operation, leaving some wondering if there was more sentience in their bots than they once believed.</p>
								<h3>Human, A Species</h3>
								<p>Humans were discovered lost in the galaxy when dozens of ships were searching for a planet to make their home. Having descended over many generations, these humans had never seen Zauke, Mars, or even Earth for themselves. Living in space for so long, humans had built exosuits to protect and enhance their bodies.</p>
